  /*
    This class is for simply submitting a request from a user to view their request history of current and previous requests
    that have been made to that email address. The user must input their email and their secret code. This is not the most
    secure, as this is sent to them in plain text via email, but given as we opted for a lightweight log-in-free webapp, this
    is the best option to not allow any user to see the requests from any other user.
